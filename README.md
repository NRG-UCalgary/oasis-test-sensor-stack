# Oasis Sensor Stack
A sample sensor stack code consisting of two components:
- Sensor: 
    - Sensors simply transmit some data to the server on a fixed interval
    - Sensors should log their throughput (requests per second)
- Server: 
    - Server passively receives data from sensors

# TODO:
 - Implement the stack using CoAP instead of HTTP

# NOTE: 
This project is part of the Oasis performance analysis and measurement system.
